# kindletospeech - create an audiobook as well as get the text version of your book.

This is for windows - for a mac you will be able to get the text and can use something else to get the voice (mac voices are bad :/)
1. Download Code and firefox 
2. pip install all packages
2. Install and add tesseract OCR to your path (if you dont have this currently just make sure that you download online)
3. Login to kindle and navigate to the book you want to read
4. Navigate to the first page of the book you would like to read
5. Dont open any other browsers until the book is done and wait until the full book is done the program will give you an mp3 of the book read aloud
6. It will also give you an mp3 version of your book. You can put this on your phone and use an audiobook app like readaloud!
